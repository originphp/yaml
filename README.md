The YAML utility is for reading (parsing) and writing YAML files. 

> The YAML utility does not cover the complete specification, it is designed to read and write configuration files, and data from the database so that it can be read and edited in user friendly way.

## Installation

To install this package

```linux
$ composer require originphp/yaml
```

## Create a YAML string

```php
use Origin\Yaml\Yaml;
$employees = [
    ['name'=>'Jim','skills'=>['php','mysql','puppeteer']],
    ['name'=>'Amy','skills'=>['ruby','ruby on rails']],
];
$yaml = Yaml::fromArray($employees );
```

That will return the following

```yaml
- name: Jim
  skills:
    - php
    - mysql
    - puppeteer
- name: Amy
  skills:
    - ruby
    - ruby on rails
```

Here is an example converting a record using the Bookmark model

```php
 $bookmark = $this->Bookmark->get(1,[
            'associated'=>[
                'User','Tag'
                ]
            ]);
$string = Yaml::fromArray($bookmark->toArray()); 

```

This will create the following YAML string:

```yaml

user_id: 1

## Read YAML

To create an array from a YAML string

```php
$employee =  'name: Tom
position: developer
skills:
    - php
    - mysql
    - js
addresses:
    - street: 14 some road
      city: london
    - street: 21 some avenue
      city: leeds
summary:
    this is a text description
    for this employee';
$array = Yaml::toArray($employee);
/*
Array
(
    [name] => Tom
    [position] => developer
    [skills] => Array
        (
            [0] => php
            [1] => mysql
            [2] => js
        )

    [addresses] => Array
        (
            [0] => Array
                (
                    [street] => 14 some road
                    [city] => london
                )

            [1] => Array
                (
                    [street] => 21 some avenue
                    [city] => leeds
                )

        )

    [summary] => this is a text description for this employee
)
*/
```
